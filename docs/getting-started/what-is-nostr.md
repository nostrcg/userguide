# What is Nostr?

Nostr is a **decentralized social network** that gives you complete control over your online identity and data. Unlike traditional social media platforms owned by corporations, Nostr is an open protocol that anyone can use.

## The Basics

Think of Nostr like email, but for social media:

- **You own your identity** - Your account isn't controlled by any company
- **You choose your app** - Many different apps work with the same account
- **Your content is yours** - Take your followers anywhere you go
- **No central authority** - No one can ban you from the entire network

## How It Works (Simply Put)

![How Nostr Works](/img/diagrams/nostr-flow.svg)

1. **You** use an app (called a "client") to write posts
2. **Relays** are servers that store and share your posts
3. **Others** see your posts through their apps

## What Makes Nostr Different?

| Traditional Social Media | Nostr |
|-------------------------|-------|
| Company owns your account | You own your keys |
| Locked into one app | Use any compatible app |
| Platform can delete your account | No central authority |
| Algorithms control what you see | You choose your experience |
| Your data is the product | Your data is yours |

## Real-World Analogy

Imagine if you could:
- Write a letter once and have it delivered to multiple post offices
- Anyone could pick it up from any post office they trust
- You sign every letter with your unique seal that can't be forged
- No single post office could stop you from sending mail

That's essentially how Nostr works!

## Getting Started

Ready to try it? Here's what you'll need:

1. **A client (app)** - We'll help you choose one
2. **Your keys** - Like a username and password, but better
3. **Some relays** - Most apps set these up automatically

:::tip No Email Required
Unlike most platforms, Nostr doesn't require an email address or phone number. Your identity is cryptographic, which means it's mathematically yours.
