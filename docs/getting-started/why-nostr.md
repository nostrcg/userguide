# Why Choose Nostr?

There are many reasons people are moving to Nostr. Here are the most important ones.

## Freedom & Ownership

### You Own Your Identity

On traditional platforms, your account belongs to the company. They can:
- Suspend or delete your account
- Change the rules anytime
- Sell your data
- Disappear (remember Vine, Google+?)

On Nostr, **you own your cryptographic keys**. No one can take your identity away.

### Censorship Resistant

Because Nostr is decentralized:
- No single company controls it
- Your posts exist on multiple servers
- If one server bans you, you can use others
- Your followers stay with you

## Interoperability

### One Account, Many Apps

Your Nostr identity works across all Nostr apps:

| Want to... | Use apps like... |
|------------|-----------------|
| Microblog (like Twitter) | Damus, Primal, Amethyst |
| Long-form writing | Habla, Yakihonne |
| Share photos | Olas, Nostragram |
| Stream video | Zap.stream |
| Chat | 0xchat, Coracle |
| Listen to podcasts | Fountain |

**Same account. Same followers. Different experiences.**

### Take Your Followers

Switching apps? Your followers come with you automatically because they follow your **key**, not an account on a specific platform.

## Privacy & Security

### No Personal Data Required

- No email address needed
- No phone number needed
- No real name needed
- Sign up in seconds

### Cryptographic Security

Every post you make is **signed** with your private key:
- People can verify posts are really from you
- No one can forge your messages
- No one can alter your posts

## Bitcoin Integration

Nostr has native integration with Bitcoin's Lightning Network:

### Zaps

Send small Bitcoin payments (called "zaps") directly to content creators:
- Tip a post you like

- Zaps go directly to creators
- No minimum payout thresholds
- No waiting periods
- Works globally
