## Step 1: Choose an App

Pick an app based on your device:

### Mobile (Recommended for Beginners)

## Step 2: Create Your Account

:::tip Easier Than You Think
Most apps make this incredibly simple. Just tap "Create Account" and you're done!
:::

### What Happens When You Create an Account

1. The app generates two **keys** for you:
   - **Public key (npub)** - Like your username, share freely
   - **Private key (nsec)** - Like your password, keep secret!

2. You can optionally add:
   - Display name
   - Profile picture
   - Bio

### Important: Back Up Your Private Key!

Your private key is the **only** way to access your account. The app should show you this key when you create your account.

**Write it down and store it safely!**

If you lose it:
- No company can reset it
- You'll lose access to your account forever

## Step 3: Set Up Your Profile

1. **Add a name** - Can be a nickname, real name, anything you want
2. **Add a profile picture** - Optional but helps people recognize you
3. **Write a short bio** - Tell people about yourself
4. **Add a Lightning address** - So people can tip you (optional)

## Step 4: Find People to Follow

### In the App
Most apps have:
- Suggested users to follow
- Global feeds to discover content
- Search to find specific people

### Popular Accounts to Start

Here are some friendly accounts to follow:
- Search for "Nostr" to find community accounts
- Look for people posting about topics you enjoy
- Check out who others are following

### Find Friends
If friends are already on Nostr, they can share their **public key (npub)** with you. Just paste it into the search!
