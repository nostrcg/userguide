## Notifications

### Push Notifications

Most mobile apps support push notifications for:
- New followers
- Mentions
- Replies to your posts
- Zaps received

**To enable:** Check Settings → Notifications in your app

### How They Work

Unlike traditional apps, Nostr notifications work through relay subscriptions. Some apps use their own notification servers for reliability.

## Tips for Mobile Users

### Battery Life
- Reduce number of relays (fewer connections)
- Disable auto-refresh if not needed
- Use push notifications instead of constant polling

### Data Usage
- Most apps cache content efficiently
- Images/videos use the most data
- Consider using WiFi for media-heavy browsing

### Multiple Accounts
Some apps support multiple accounts:
- **Nostur** - Full multi-account support
- **Amethyst** - Account switching
